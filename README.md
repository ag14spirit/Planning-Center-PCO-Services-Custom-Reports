# Planning Center PCO Services Custom Reports
 These customized plans print to include the exact information needed on a given printout by using HTML, CSS and Liquid reporting tags.

## Inspiration
Enclosed templates were largely inspired by the iterative `forloop` [from this repo](https://github.com/josephdadams/PlanningCenterServicesReports) that generates a singly printable packet for the entire team at once.

The need for these report templates was driven toward more granular flexibility by the need to operate with a large-scale volunteer team of nearly 70 volunteers and staff for an anniversary gathering of our multisite campuses.
